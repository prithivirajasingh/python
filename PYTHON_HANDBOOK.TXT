# Reassigning Variables: +=, -=, *=, and /=

# You can check what type of object is assigned to a variable using Python's built-in type() function. Common data types include:
int (for integer)
float
str (for string)
list
tuple
dict (for dictionary)
set
bool (for Boolean True/False)

# STRINGS:
print('Hello World 1')
len("Hello World")
s = 'Hello World'; s[0]; s[1:]; s[:3]; s[-1]
s[:-1] # Grab everything but the last letter
s[::2] # Grab everything, but go in step sizes of 2
s[::-1] # Print a string backwards
s = s + ' concatenate me!' # Concatenate strings
s * 3 # Create repetition
